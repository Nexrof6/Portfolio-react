          <h2 className="display-6 pt-3">What is AGI?</h2>
          <p>
            Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to AI systems that
            possess the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge in a
            manner similar to human cognition across a broad range of tasks and
            contexts. Unlike narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks,
            AGI aims to emulate human-like intelligence and adaptability.
          </p>
          <h2 className="display-6 pt-3">Difference Between AGI and AI</h2>
          <p>
            AGI aims to emulate human-like intelligence across diverse tasks and
            contexts, whereas AI systems are typically designed for specific
            tasks or domains.
          </p>
          <p>
            AGI possesses the ability to adapt to new situations and tasks
            without specific programming, while AI systems are generally static
            and require reprogramming for new tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            AGI systems are designed to understand and learn from their
            environment in a manner similar to humans, whereas AI systems often
            lack deeper comprehension and operate based on patterns and data.
          </p>
          <h2 className="display-6">Advantages of AGI</h2>
          <p>
            Versatility: AGI can potentially perform a wide range of tasks,
            making it highly versatile across industries and domains.
          </p>
          <p>
            Problem-solving: AGI's ability to understand complex problems and
            learn from experiences could lead to innovative solutions in various
            fields, including healthcare, finance, and research. Human
          </p>
          <p>
            Augmentation: AGI could augment human capabilities by automating
            mundane tasks, allowing humans to focus on creative and strategic
            endeavors.
          </p>
          <h2 className="display-6">Disadvantages of AGI </h2>
          <p>
            Ethical Concerns: AGI raises significant ethical concerns, including
            the potential for misuse, job displacement, and biases embedded in
            the algorithms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Existential Risk: Some experts warn of existential risks associated
            with AGI, such as loss of control over highly intelligent systems or
            unintended consequences of their actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Socioeconomic Impacts: The widespread deployment of AGI could
            exacerbate existing socioeconomic inequalities, leading to job
            displacement and economic disruption if not managed appropriately.
